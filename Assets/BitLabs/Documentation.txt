Welcome to the Unity SDK of BitLabs.
Please read our integration carefully. More information can be found at https://bitlabs.ai/.

1. Initiate the SDK before you use it:

	// Start is called before the first frame update
	void Start()
	{
	   BitLabs.init("YOUR_TOKEN", "YOUR_USER_ID");
	}

The developer can choose the user id to identify a unique user.
We will send you a callback with this user id included for each transaction.
Typically, the user id is a UUID.

2. Call the .show() function to open the Offer Wall/Router Link

	BitLabs.show();

3. Optional: You can use .appendTag() to pass Tags to the SDK. These tags will be passed back in the callback

	BitLabs.appendTag("userType", "new");
        	BitLabs.appendTag("isPremium", "false");

4. Optional (Android only so far): Call the .setHasSurveys() to get feedback about available surveys

	// Set the name of the GameObject you would like to receive the feedback
	BitLabs.setHasSurveys(gameObject.name);
	
	// Create a receiver Method
	public void OnHasSurveys (string surveyAvailable){
        	   Debug.Log("BitLabs Unity OnHasSurveys: " + surveyAvailable);
    	}

5. Optional (Android only so far): Call the .setOnReward() to receive client-side callbacks to reward the user. We highly recommend using server-to-server callbacks!

	// Set the name of the GameObject you would like to receive the feedback
	BitLabs.setOnReward(gameObject.name);
	
	// Create a receiver Method
	public void OnReward (string payout){
	   Debug.Log("BitLabs Unity OnReward: " + payout);
    	}
