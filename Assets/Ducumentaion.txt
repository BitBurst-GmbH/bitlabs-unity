Welcome to the Unity SDK of BitLabs.
Please read our integration carefully. More information can be found at https://bitlabs.ai/.

1. Initiate the SDK before you use it:

	// Start is called before the first frame update
	void Start()
	{
	   BitLabs.init("YOUR_TOKEN", "YOUR_USER_ID");
	}

The developer can choose the user id to identify a unique user.
We will send you a callback with this user id included for each transaction.
Typically, the user id is a UUID.

2. Call the .show() function to open the Offer Wall/Router Link

	BitLabs.show();
